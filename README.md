Google Books CLI Application

Features:

Users can search the Google Books API for results related to a search query and save the results to a personal reading list. 

Overview:

This Ruby command line interface application allows users to query the Google Books API and view the first five applicable search results. Users can then select a book from the list to save to a reading list associated to that user. 

Each book displayed in the search results includes the book title, author, and publisher. Any books selected to be added to the reading list can be accessed by that user. Reading list items are locally saved separate from the Google Book's account feature
